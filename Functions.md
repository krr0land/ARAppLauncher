# 3D App Launcher

## Basic Functionality

The apps will appear on a sphere. The size of the sphere determines wheteher we use a category or all apps mode.

The sphere can appear in two different ways:

- *Frontal*: a "small" sphere appears in front of you
- *Central*: a "big" sphere appears around you

The size can be adjusted when opening the launcher.

### Opening the launcher:

Pinch gesture on both hands (close together) and  pull them apart to open the launcher in the desired size. [0->X distance]

### Readjust size:

When the launcher is open you can readjust the size to a new size. (like spawning a new one with the new size) [Z->Y distance, where Z not the ]

### Close the launcher:

Pinch gesture on both hands (far away) and push them together. [X->0 distance]

When launching an app the launcher will disappear.

### Rotating the sphere:

The user can rotate the sphere by performing a slap-like motion.

### Opening an app:

The icons are located on the sphere. In *Frontal* view the user can directly press the button to launch an app. In *Central* view the user will use a hand ray and pinch gesture to launch an app.

## Controller suppport:

Early on in the development, we will also add controller support, due to it's easier usability.

- **Opening:** Press X and use the distance of the two controllers to specify the size of the sphere.
- **Readjust:** Same as Opening.
- **Close:** Preyy the Y button.
- **Rotate:** Use the right joystick to rotate it. (horizontally only)
- **Open app:** Use the ray from the right controller and press the right trigger.
